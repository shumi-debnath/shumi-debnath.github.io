	<h1> Lee, Hershey's</h1>
	<p>	
		What a feeling to be right here beside you now <br>
		Holding you in my arms <br>
		When the air ran out and we both started running wild<br>
		The sky fell down<br>
		But you've got stars, they're in your eyes<br>
		And I've got something missing tonight<br>
		What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow<br>
		I wish I could be there now
	</p>
