	<h1>Bharatanatyam</h1>
	<p class="intro">
		<strong>Bharatanatyam</strong> also previously called <strong>Sadira Attam</strong> is a major form of Indian classical dance that is indigenous to Tamil Nadu [1]. Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition in India[citation needed]. It was nurtured in the temples and courts of southern India since ancient times[1][2][3] It is one of eight forms of dance recognized by the Sangeet Natak Akademi [4][5] (the others being Kathak, Kuchipudi, Odissi, Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Manipuri and Sattriya) and it expresses South Indian religious themes and spiritual ideas, particularly of Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism.[1][6][7]

	<p class="intro">
		Description of Bharatanatyam by 2nd century CE is noted in the ancient Tamil epic Silappatikaram, while temple sculptures of 6th to 9th century CE suggest it was a well refined performance art by the mid 1st millennium CE.[5][8] Bharatanatyam is the oldest classical dance tradition of India.[9] Theoretical foundations of the Indian classical dance laid out in Natya Shastra.[6] can be traced to various ancient art forms including Bharatanatyam.

	<h2>History</h2>
	<p class="second">
		Natya Shastra is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni, and its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE,[18][19] but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE.[20] The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters.[18][21] The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures—all of which are part of Indian classical dances.[18][22] Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text,[23] are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues and the essence of scriptures.[24]

		Many of the ancient Shiva sculptures in Hindu temples are the same as the Bharatanatyam dance poses. For example, the Cave 1 of Badami cave temples, dated to 7th-century,[30] portrays the Tandava-dancing Shiva as Nataraja.[31][32][33] The image, 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, has 18 arms in a form that expresses the dance positions arranged in a geometric pattern.[33] The arms of Shiva express mudras (symbolic hand gestures),[34] that are found in Bharatanatyam.[5][35]

	<h3>Devadasis, anti-dance movement, colonial ban and the decline</h3>
	<p>
		Some colonial Indologists and modern authors have argued that Bharatanatyam is a descendant of an ancient Devadasi (literally, servant girls of Deva temples) culture, suggesting a historical origin back to between 300 BCE and 300 CE.[36] Modern scholarship has questioned this theory for lack of any direct textual or archeological evidence.[37][38] Historic sculpture and texts do describe and project dancing girls, as well as temple quarters dedicated to women, but they do not state them to be courtesans and prostitutes as alleged by early colonial Indologists.[36] According to Davesh Soneji, a critical examination of evidence suggests that courtesan dancing is a phenomenon of the modern era, beginning in the late 16th or the 17th century of the Nayaka period of Tamil Nadu.[36] According to James Lochtefeld, Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century, only in the 20th century appearing on stage outside the temples.[8] Further, the Maratha rulers of Tanjore patronized and contributed towards Bharatanatyam.[39]

	<h3>Post-colonial revival</h3>
	<p>
		The 1910 ban triggered powerful protests against the stereotyping and dehumanization of temple dancers.[11] The Tamil people were concerned that a historic and rich dance tradition was being victimized under the excuse of social reform.[11][44] The classical art revivalists such as E. Krishna Iyer, a lawyer and someone who had learnt the Bharatanatyam dance, questioned the cultural discrimination and the assumed connection, asking why prostitution needs years of learning and training for performance arts such as the Bharatanatyam, and how can killing performance arts end any evils in a society?[45][46] Iyer was arrested and sentenced to prison on charges of nationalism, who while serving out his prison term persuaded his fellow political prisoners to support Bharatanatyam.[47]
